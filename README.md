# Open Seat
## Use case
Open Seat is an experimental seating organisation tool. **It is not intended as a real product you can use for serious events.** If you do it anyway, let me know how it went.

This tool has been developed to run and manage a local school prom. Therefore you wont see anything you might expect from a professional tool. It only contains the features we need. But besides, have fun!

## Run
Clone this repository and make sure you've got a running Rust environment. You can use [this tutorial](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites).


If everything is done, run the project:

```bash
cargo tauri dev
```
If everything goes by plan, you should see a new window on your screen. If it does contain some cool buttons and text, you did everything right. Congrats!
